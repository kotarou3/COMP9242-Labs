This is a generic, OS independent acpi library.

INITIALISATION

#include <acpi/acpi.h>
#include <acpi/regions.h>

The function acpi_init will parse the acpi tables and bring them into
virtual memory. It requires two functions from the user:

    * acpi_map_paddr to map a physical area of memory (to any virtual
    address).
    * acpi_unmap_vaddr to unmap an area mapped with the
    previous function.

The parsing works by mapping in all of the acpi tables one by one and
copying them to memory allocated with malloc. The mapped table will then
be unmapped. This avoids requiring all of physical memory to be mapped
at a constant offset (which isn't an option really, as on x86 this could
be our entire address range).

FINDING ACPI TABLES

Once acpi_init has been called, use acpi_find_region with the constants
in acpi/regions.h to find the table you are looking for.

CAUTION

Not all tables are implemented. If you can't find the table you are
looking for, dig into the source. Sorry.

There are debugging functions in src/printer* and src/browser*. These have
not been tested recently, but are left in case they are required in future.
